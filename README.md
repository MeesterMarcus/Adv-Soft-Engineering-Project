# How to work on each of your own branches:

1. Open git shell or open terminal
2. Clone repository using git clone 
3. Switch to your branch using the command: git checkout yourbranch
4. Make any updates or additions normally, using git add and commits, etc.
5. **Important:** When pushing, use the command git push origin yourbranch

**Note**:

-To avoid issues, don't open the project while it is still in the git folder in which it was pulled. Copy the project into a place outside of the git folder where you locally store unity projects, and open that one within Unity.
